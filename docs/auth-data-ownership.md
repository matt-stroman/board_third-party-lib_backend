## Purpose

Authentication is now delegated to Keycloak. That changes what the backend should persist in PostgreSQL and what it should treat as externally managed identity state.

Use this document when deciding whether new identity-related data belongs in:

- the Keycloak realm configuration, or
- the backend PostgreSQL schema.

## Current State

Current implemented behavior:

- Keycloak hosts login and self-registration.
- Keycloak owns credentials, email verification, external identity-provider linkage, session/token lifecycle, and platform role assignment.
- The backend validates Keycloak-issued bearer tokens and reads platform roles from JWT claims.
- The backend mediates current-user developer enrollment by calling Keycloak admin APIs to assign the `developer` role directly; moderator workflows can assign or remove `verified_developer` for developer accounts.
- Keycloak is also the intended broker for future Google, Facebook, Steam, Epic Games, and similar SSO providers.
- PostgreSQL is now the source of truth for the application-owned `users` projection and optional `user_board_profiles` linkage/cache.

Wave 1 EF Core migrations for `users` and `user_board_profiles` are implemented. This document defines the ongoing ownership boundary as later schema waves are added.

## What Keycloak Owns

Keycloak is the source of truth for:

- usernames and login identifiers
- passwords and credential policies
- email verification and password reset flows
- linked external identity providers
- platform roles such as `player`, `developer`, `verified_developer`, `super_admin`, `admin`, and `moderator`
- session and token issuance/revocation state
- the persisted result of developer enrollment when the backend requests Keycloak to grant the `developer` realm role

These concerns should not be duplicated in PostgreSQL as primary auth tables.

## What PostgreSQL Owns

PostgreSQL remains the source of truth for application-owned domain data, including:

- studios and memberships
- titles, metadata, media assets, releases, artifacts, supported publishers, integration connections, and acquisition bindings
- payment, entitlement, and install-delivery data when those areas are implemented
- optional Board profile linkage/cache owned by this application
- application-managed profile fields for display purposes (for example display name, first/last name, username, and avatar preferences/content)
- an application user projection for linking domain records to a Keycloak subject

Board profile persistence is implemented application data and is now part of the current API surface.

## Schema Implications

For the application database, the current direction is:

- do not introduce `user_password_credentials`
- do not introduce `user_email_addresses` as an auth-management model
- do not introduce `user_external_identities` for social/OIDC provider ownership
- do not make PostgreSQL the source of truth for platform role assignment

When the application needs a persisted user record, model it as an application identity projection linked to Keycloak. The expected minimum shape is:

- `users`
  - stable application user ID (`uuid`)
  - immutable `keycloak_subject` or equivalent unique external subject key
  - optional cached display fields when needed for local query/display convenience
- `user_board_profiles`
  - optional Board linkage/cache associated with the local `users` row

Important:

- cached Keycloak fields in PostgreSQL should be treated as non-authoritative snapshots
- platform authorization should continue to use Keycloak role claims unless a future local projection is justified by query/reporting needs

## Local Development Notes

Local identity seed data is currently provided by Keycloak realm import, not PostgreSQL seed scripts:

- Keycloak realm import file: [`backend/keycloak/import/board-third-party-library-realm.json`](../keycloak/import/board-third-party-library-realm.json)
- Local login test user: `local-admin` / `ChangeMe!123`

For richer local UI/UX validation data, use the root seed command:

```bash
python ./scripts/dev.py seed-data --reset-media
```

That workflow provisions deterministic local Keycloak users/roles and repopulates local PostgreSQL catalog test data.

If new platform roles are introduced, update both:

- the Keycloak realm import
- the backend role catalog exposed by the API
