## Purpose

Use this document for the current title/catalog schema and behavioral rules around titles, versioned metadata, media, releases, artifact metadata, and external acquisition bindings.

This is a maintained design/reference doc, but it is not a second exhaustive schema source of truth. Exact column names, constraints, comments, and foreign keys still live in EF Core configurations and migrations.

## Current Scope

The current implemented scope includes:

- public catalog browsing via `/catalog`
- storefront-style public title detail via `/catalog/{studioSlug}/{titleSlug}`
- authenticated title management scoped to studios
- versioned metadata snapshots for player-facing catalog copy
- draft/testing/published/archived lifecycle state
- private/unlisted/listed visibility state
- ESRB/PEGI-style age rating authority and value fields
- fixed media slots for card, hero, and logo assets
- semver release records bound to metadata revisions
- APK artifact metadata records for published releases
- supported publisher registry, reusable studio-level publisher connections, and title-level acquisition bindings

## Public Routing And Discoverability

Public title routing is studio-scoped to prevent ambiguity across different developers:

- `/catalog/{studioSlug}/{titleSlug}`

Discoverability is intentionally separate from lifecycle:

- `listed` titles appear in public catalog browse results when the title is in `testing` or `published`
- `unlisted` titles do not appear in public browse results, but public detail remains reachable by direct route key
- `private` titles are not publicly reachable

## Relational Tables

The current title/catalog surface uses these PostgreSQL tables:

- `titles`
- `title_metadata_versions`
- `title_media_assets`
- `title_releases`
- `release_artifacts`
- `supported_publishers`
- `integration_connections`
- `title_integration_bindings`

High-level ownership split:

- `titles` stores stable title identity, owning studio, lifecycle state, visibility, and the pointer to the currently active metadata revision
- `title_metadata_versions` stores player-facing metadata snapshots with per-title revision numbers
- `title_media_assets` stores fixed Board-style media slots per title
- `title_releases` stores semver release history bound to a title and one metadata revision
- `release_artifacts` stores installable artifact metadata for a release
- `supported_publishers` stores platform-managed canonical publisher/store registry entries
- `integration_connections` stores reusable studio-owned supported/custom publisher connections
- `title_integration_bindings` stores title-scoped external acquisition links

Important integrity rules:

- title slugs are unique only within an studio
- metadata revision numbers are unique only within a title
- `titles.current_metadata_version_id` is constrained so it can only reference metadata that belongs to the same title
- media roles are unique only within a title
- release versions are unique only within a title
- `title_releases.metadata_version_id` is constrained so a release can only reference metadata that belongs to the same title
- `titles.current_release_id` is constrained so it can only reference a release that belongs to the same title
- artifact identity is unique only within a release by `(package_name, version_code)`
- title acquisition bindings allow at most one enabled primary binding per title
- title acquisition bindings cannot mark a binding as primary while disabled

## Lifecycle And Visibility Model

`titles.lifecycle_status` currently allows:

- `draft`
- `testing`
- `published`
- `archived`

`titles.visibility` currently allows:

- `private`
- `unlisted`
- `listed`

Current behavior:

- `draft` titles must be `private`
- `testing` and `published` titles can use any visibility value
- `archived` titles remain queryable to authorized developers but are excluded from public catalog behavior

## Metadata Revision Behavior

Metadata revisions continue to use the agreed "mutable draft, frozen after draft" model.

Current behavior:

- creating a title requires an initial metadata revision
- the first metadata revision is revision `1`
- while a title is still `draft` and its current revision is not frozen, metadata updates happen in place
- when a title leaves `draft`, the active metadata revision is frozen
- once a title is no longer `draft`, further metadata edits create a new revision and repoint `current_metadata_version_id`
- developers can reactivate an older revision, which supports rollback
- activating a revision for a non-draft title freezes that revision if it was not already frozen

This preserves low churn during drafting while still keeping stable metadata history once a title becomes public-facing.

## Media Asset Model

Wave 4 adds fixed-slot media rows for Board-style catalog presentation.

Current behavior:

- each title can have at most one `card`, one `hero`, and one `logo` asset
- media assets are title-scoped rather than metadata-revision-scoped
- each media row stores an external `source_url`, optional `alt_text`, optional `mime_type`, and optional width/height pair
- width and height must either both be absent or both be positive
- developers can set media with either URL upsert (`PUT /developer/titles/{titleId}/media/{mediaRole}`) or file upload (`POST /developer/titles/{titleId}/media/{mediaRole}/upload`)
- file upload currently accepts JPEG, PNG, WEBP, and GIF up to 25 MB
- public catalog browse currently surfaces the card image URL when present

## Release And Artifact Model

Wave 4 adds semver releases and installable artifact metadata.

Current release behavior:

- each release belongs to exactly one title
- each release binds to exactly one metadata revision so shipped binaries always point at a known catalog snapshot
- release `status` currently allows `draft`, `published`, and `withdrawn`
- only `published` releases can be activated as `titles.current_release_id`
- developers can activate an older published release to support rollback
- withdrawing the active release clears `titles.current_release_id`
- draft releases remain mutable; published or withdrawn releases are treated as immutable history by the API

Current artifact behavior:

- artifacts currently allow `artifact_kind = apk` only
- artifact rows store package identity plus optional integrity metadata
- artifact rows do not yet expose or persist install/download URLs
- publishing a release requires at least one artifact

## Acquisition Model

Wave 5 adds publisher-agnostic external acquisition support.

Current supported publisher behavior:

- `supported_publishers` is a platform-managed canonical registry
- supported publishers are seeded through EF Core migrations
- developers can list supported publishers and choose one when configuring an studio connection

Current integration connection behavior:

- each `integration_connection` belongs to exactly one studio
- a connection must point to either one supported publisher or one custom publisher definition
- custom publisher connections currently require both display name and homepage URL
- provider-specific non-secret configuration can be stored in `config_json`
- deleting a connection is blocked while any title binding still references it

Current title acquisition binding behavior:

- each binding belongs to exactly one title and one integration connection
- bindings expose the external `acquisition_url` players should visit
- enabled bindings must maintain exactly one enabled primary binding when any enabled bindings exist
- enabling a new primary binding demotes the previous primary binding
- public catalog responses derive acquisition data only from the current enabled primary binding whose connection is also enabled

## Public API Shape

Waves 4 and 5 extend public catalog responses without exposing install delivery.

Current behavior:

- `GET /catalog` can include `cardImageUrl` and `acquisitionUrl` in title summaries
- `GET /catalog/{studioSlug}/{titleSlug}` includes `mediaAssets`, `currentRelease`, and `acquisition`
- `currentRelease` is a summary view only; artifact internals remain developer-only
- developer endpoints manage media, releases, publish/activate/withdraw transitions, artifact metadata, and title acquisition bindings under `/developer/titles/{titleId}/...`
- developer endpoints manage studio-level publisher connections under `/developer/studios/{studioId}/integration-connections`
- supported publisher discovery is exposed publicly through `GET /supported-publishers`

## Age Ratings And Derived Display Fields

Wave 3 stores structured rating data as:

- `age_rating_authority`
- `age_rating_value`
- `min_age_years`

This supports ESRB/PEGI-style labels without hard-coding a single regional system.

Wave 3 does not persist presentation-only display strings for:

- player counts
- age rating display

Instead, the API derives:

- `playerCountDisplay` from `minPlayers` and `maxPlayers`
- `ageDisplay` from `ageRatingAuthority` and `ageRatingValue`

## Out Of Scope For The Current Wave Boundary

The following remain out of scope after Wave 5:

- checkout, orders, entitlements, and monetization flows
- Board-device install orchestration and artifact delivery URLs
- shared custom-publisher registry management endpoints beyond the seeded supported publisher catalog

Semver belongs on `title_releases`, not on `title_metadata_versions`. Metadata revisions capture catalog copy, not release identity. Artifact delivery remains deferred until the Board-device workflow is defined.
